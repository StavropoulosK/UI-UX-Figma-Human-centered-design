# UI-UX-Figma-Human-centered-design

This is the group project of Stavropoulos Konstantinos and Charalampopoulos Dimitrios for the Interactive Technologies course of the University of Patras for the academic year 2024-2025.

In this project we analyze, evaluate and redesign a document scanning application using human
centered design principles. Initially, we study some available applications and from them we 
choose one, Microsoft Lens, that seems to have some areas which can be improved.

Moreover we use human-centered design methods and perform user analysis to 
understand and define typical users. Afterwards we do task analysis to understand exactly what 
tasks a user does with a scanning application. Moreover, we do requirement analysis and define
the functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

Additionally we evaluate Microsoft Lens app with both expert and user based evaluation 
methods. For the formative assessment of the application we do user based evaluation using the 
think aloud protocol and expert based evaluation using heuristic evaluation. For the conclusive 
evaluation of the application, the method of questionnaires is used for users, namely the User 
Experience questionnaire. For expert evaluation, the conclusive assessment is made using the 
KLM method. Both formative evaluation by users and experts highlighted some usability 
issues. Also, the questionnaire method showed that typical users who participated in the 
evaluation of the application considered the app averagely designed.

Afterwards, we analyze the received feedback and in combination with the requirements that 
were defined during requirement analysis we redesign the application in Figma to effectively 
address all the problems that were observed. In fact, we created detailed prototypes showing all 
the individual functions of the application and the way the user will interact with it. Additionally, 
the prototypes were re-evaluated with user based methods and the issues observed have been 
corrected. The final version of the prototypes can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/DEWXOAiI9v0SlVEOiWMIV3/Scanner-App?node-id=0-1&t=IKaZQpYARTGxII1s-1). 

Finally, we compared the time to do a standard 3-page scan with the original application and ours, 
and found that the time required with our own application is about 3 seconds less. This time 
saving is very important for an app like Microsoft Lens that is used by millions of users every 
month.
